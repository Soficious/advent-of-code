I was introduced to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in November, 2020 by a mere chance on Twitter. It seemed fun, it was good for practice and for improving my skills (either in programming and logic) so I thought, why the hell not?

This repository sole existence is to keep all the code of the Advent. Will be separating by years since I really, really want to do this every year from now on.
